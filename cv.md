# Briefly about me:
I am 20 years old, I recently graduated from a pedagogical university. I became interested in programming last year. I tried courses from the university, but they weren't that easy, so I didn't get much out of it. But I realized an important thing for me, I like to do it. I continued to do front-end development in another course, which helped me understand what I would like to do in the future. 
I believe that I can improve my knowledge and development skills and get a job in the future.
